Math Blocker is a Chrome extension that blocks distracting websites by making users answer a series of math questions. 

Built using: JavaScript, React (Create React app), Redux, Chrome API

When loading a blocked website, a popup appears with a series of math questions. The user cannot access the site until they have completed all questions. Once the questions are finished, the site can only be used for a previously specified amount of time before another set of questions appears.

The user defines a list of websites, and specifies when the block is "on".

The user also defines how difficult each question is, and how many questions are asked before the user can go to the website.
